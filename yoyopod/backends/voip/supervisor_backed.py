"""VoIPBackend implementation that delegates to a sidecar process.

Production wires this backend up when ``YOYOPOD_VOIP_SIDECAR=1`` is set.
The :class:`SidecarSupervisor` owns the sidecar process; this backend
adapts the synchronous :class:`yoyopod.backends.voip.protocol.VoIPBackend`
surface that :class:`VoIPManager` already consumes onto the asynchronous
command/event protocol the sidecar speaks.

Translation responsibilities:

* :meth:`start` / :meth:`stop` drive ``supervisor.start()`` /
  ``supervisor.stop()`` and send ``Configure`` / ``Register`` /
  ``Unregister`` commands at the right moments.
* Per-call methods (:meth:`make_call`, :meth:`answer_call`,
  :meth:`hangup`, :meth:`mute`, :meth:`unmute`, ...) translate to
  ``Dial`` / ``Accept`` / ``Reject`` / ``Hangup`` / ``SetMute`` commands.
* Backend events emitted by the sidecar are translated back to
  :class:`yoyopod.integrations.call.models.VoIPEvent` instances and fired
  to the callbacks registered via :meth:`on_event` so callers do not
  need to know whether the backend is in-process or sidecar-backed.

Phase 2B.4 wired text messaging. Phase 2B.4b adds voice-note recording
and sending. :meth:`stop_voice_note_recording` returns an optimistic
duration computed from main's monotonic clock (start-to-stop elapsed)
so the existing synchronous :class:`VoIPBackend` contract is preserved
without a blocking pipe round-trip; the sidecar's actual file duration
arrives later in the corresponding :class:`MessageReceived` event and
the manager can reconcile it into the persisted record.
