## Config

Use `deploy/pi-deploy.yaml` as the shared deploy contract and `deploy/pi-deploy.local.yaml` for machine-specific overrides such as host, SSH user, and the dev lane checkout. The tracked dev default is `project_dir: /opt/yoyopod-dev/checkout`; prod slots live under `/opt/yoyopod-prod`. `yoyopod remote` merges the files directly, and `yoyopod remote config edit` is the preferred way to create or update the local override.

If the file does not exist yet, run `yoyopod remote config edit` first. That command creates `deploy/pi-deploy.local.yaml` automatically before opening it.

## Steps

1. **Confirm this is really a dirty-tree override.** Only use this skill if the user explicitly wants to validate uncommitted local state or asks for a dirty-tree debugging shortcut. Otherwise stop and recommend `/yoyopod-deploy`.

2. **Switch the board into the dev lane.** Run:
   ```bash
   yoyopod remote mode status
   yoyopod remote mode activate dev
   ```

3. **Sync the dirty working tree into `/opt/yoyopod-dev/checkout`.** Run:
   ```bash
   yoyopod remote sync
   ```

4. **If branch switching may have stale native CMake caches,** run:
   ```bash
   yoyopod remote sync --clean-native
   ```

5. **If the user explicitly wants sync without restart,** run:
   ```bash
   yoyopod remote sync --skip-restart
   ```

6. **Handle failures.** If the sync or restart step fails, run:
   ```bash
   yoyopod remote logs --lines 20
   ```
   Include the relevant error output in your response.

7. **Report the result clearly.** Say that this mutated the dev lane checkout, was a dirty-tree validation override, and was not the normal committed branch/SHA workflow.
