# Rust UI Host

The Rust UI Host is the Whisplay UI owner. Python still owns the app/runtime
services for now; Rust owns UI state, screen focus, one-button transitions, and
Whisplay rendering when the host is enabled or launched directly.

## Build

```bash
yoyopod build rust-ui-host
```

For host-only protocol tests:

```bash
yoyopod build rust-ui-host --no-hardware-feature
```

CI builds the Whisplay host on a native Linux ARM64 runner and uploads it as the
`yoyopod-ui-host-${{ github.sha }}` artifact.

For Raspberry Pi Zero 2W hardware validation, the deploy path is always:

1. Commit and push the branch.
2. Wait for the GitHub Actions `ui-rust` job to pass for the exact commit.
3. Download the matching `yoyopod-ui-host-<sha>` artifact.
4. Copy it to `src/crates/ui-host/build/yoyopod-ui-host` on the Pi checkout.

Do not run `cargo build` or `yoyopod build rust-ui-host` on the Pi Zero 2W
unless the user explicitly overrides this rule. Local builds are for developer
workstations, CI, or faster ARM64 boards only.

## Required Whisplay Environment

The hardware backend reads explicit GPIO/SPI settings:

- `YOYOPOD_WHISPLAY_SPI_BUS`
- `YOYOPOD_WHISPLAY_SPI_CS`
- `YOYOPOD_WHISPLAY_SPI_HZ`
- `YOYOPOD_WHISPLAY_DC_GPIO`
- `YOYOPOD_WHISPLAY_RESET_GPIO`
- `YOYOPOD_WHISPLAY_BACKLIGHT_GPIO`
- `YOYOPOD_WHISPLAY_BACKLIGHT_ACTIVE_LOW`
- `YOYOPOD_WHISPLAY_BUTTON_GPIO`
- `YOYOPOD_WHISPLAY_BUTTON_ACTIVE_LOW`

The Whisplay defaults match the vendor board mapping:

- SPI bus `0`, chip select `0`, speed `100000000`
- DC GPIO `27`
- reset GPIO `4`
- backlight GPIO `22`, active low
- button GPIO `17`, active high

## Run On Pi

First copy the CI artifact into the dev checkout and make it executable:

```bash
mkdir -p src/crates/ui-host/build
chmod +x src/crates/ui-host/build/yoyopod-ui-host
```

```bash
yoyopod pi rust-ui-host --worker src/crates/ui-host/build/yoyopod-ui-host --frames 10
```

Expected result:

- the Whisplay display shows changing test frames or the requested hub screen
- the command prints a `ui.ready` payload
- the command prints a `ui.health` payload

For one-button validation, run both checks:

- no-touch `ui.tick` loop: should produce `button_events=0`
- physical button click while ticking: should emit `ui.input` and move focus

## Runtime Protocol

The Rust host accepts these UI-owner commands over line-delimited JSON:

- `ui.runtime_snapshot` - Python sends the latest app/runtime snapshot. Rust
  applies call/loading/error preemption, owns the active screen, renders the
  screen, and emits `ui.screen_changed` when the Rust route changes.
- `ui.input_action` - Python or tests inject one semantic action
  (`advance`, `select`, `back`, `ptt_press`, `ptt_release`). Rust applies it to
  the active screen and emits `ui.intent` when Python runtime work is needed.
- `ui.tick` - Rust polls the Whisplay button, runs the one-button gesture
  machine, applies generated actions, emits intents, and renders dirty screens.

The compatibility Python bridge currently lives in `yoyopod/ui/rust_sidecar/`.
The production-facing package name is being promoted to `yoyopod/ui/rust_host/`
as part of the UI ownership migration.
