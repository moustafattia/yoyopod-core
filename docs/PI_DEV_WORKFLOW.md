# Raspberry Pi Dev Workflow

This guide covers the normal dev-machine-to-board loop for YoyoPod.

The default contract is:

1. finish the implementation locally
2. commit the intended changes
3. push the branch
4. validate that committed branch and exact SHA on the Pi
5. leave the app running for manual hardware testing

Dirty-tree sync still exists, but only as a rare debugging override.

## Stable Board Checkout

The Raspberry Pi should reuse one stable checkout path, configured by `project_dir` in `deploy/pi-deploy.yaml`.

Why this is the default:

- `uv sync` is expensive on Pi Zero hardware
- native LVGL and Liblinphone rebuilds can be expensive
- repeated fresh copies waste time
- the service unit, logs, PID file, and restart flow all assume one stable path

Do not normalize ad hoc per-branch checkout directories on the board.

## Setup

Make sure your dev machine can SSH into the Raspberry Pi with an alias or reachable host name.

The repo-tracked deploy contract lives in `deploy/pi-deploy.yaml`.

- keep `host` and `user` blank there
- keep the shared `project_dir` stable there
- put machine-specific values in `deploy/pi-deploy.local.yaml`
- create or update that file with:

```bash
yoyoctl remote config edit
```

Examples:

```bash
ssh rpi-zero
ssh tifo@192.168.1.42
```

Optional environment defaults:

```bash
export YOYOPOD_PI_HOST=rpi-zero
export YOYOPOD_PI_PROJECT_DIR=~/YoyoPod_Core
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:YOYOPOD_PI_HOST="rpi-zero"
$env:YOYOPOD_PI_PROJECT_DIR="~/YoyoPod_Core"
```

## Default Validate-On-Board Flow

Use this when validating a feature branch or PR on target hardware.

1. Confirm the local tree is committed:
   ```bash
   git status --short
   ```
2. Resolve the branch and exact commit:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git rev-parse HEAD
   ```
3. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
   If the branch has no upstream yet:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch>
   ```
4. Run the repo-owned hardware validation flow:
   ```bash
   yoyoctl remote validate --branch <branch> --sha <commit>
   ```

Useful variations:

```bash
yoyoctl remote validate --branch <branch> --sha <commit> --with-music --with-voip
yoyoctl remote validate --branch <branch> --sha <commit> --with-power --with-rtc
yoyoctl remote validate --branch <branch> --sha <commit> --with-lvgl-soak
yoyoctl remote validate --branch <branch> --sha <commit> --skip-uv-sync
```

`yoyoctl remote validate` does all of this:

1. stops if the local worktree is dirty
2. verifies the requested branch is pushed
3. syncs the stable Pi checkout to the branch and exact SHA
4. runs `uv sync --extra dev` unless skipped
5. runs the requested smoke checks
6. restarts the app
7. verifies startup with the PID file and startup marker
8. prints the latest startup marker and recent logs
9. leaves the app running for manual testing

## Lower-Level Commands

### Check remote status

```bash
yoyoctl remote status
```

Shows:

- remote branch or `DETACHED`
- remote commit
- dirty working tree state on the Pi checkout
- music backend process state
- tracked PID file state
- latest startup marker from the file log
- top memory processes

### Sync committed code without launching the app

```bash
yoyoctl remote sync --branch <branch>
yoyoctl remote sync --branch <branch> --sha <commit>
```

Use this when you want the stable checkout updated but do not want the full validate flow yet.

### Run smoke validation only

```bash
yoyoctl remote smoke
yoyoctl remote smoke --with-power --with-rtc
yoyoctl remote smoke --with-music --with-voip --with-rtc
yoyoctl remote smoke --with-lvgl-soak
```

Useful variations:

```bash
yoyoctl remote smoke --with-music --music-timeout 10
yoyoctl remote smoke --with-voip --voip-timeout 15 --verbose
```

### Restart the already-synced app

```bash
yoyoctl remote restart
```

This waits for the startup marker and matching PID before returning success.

### Structured file logs

```bash
yoyoctl remote logs --lines 200
yoyoctl remote logs --errors
yoyoctl remote logs --filter voip
yoyoctl remote logs --filter coord
yoyoctl remote logs --follow --filter ERROR
```

This tails the file sinks declared in `deploy/pi-deploy.yaml`, which is the stable Pi contract for:

- `<project-dir>/logs/yoyopod.log`
- `<project-dir>/logs/yoyopod_errors.log`
- `/tmp/yoyopod.pid`

For keep-alive freeze triage, watch the `voip` and `coord` lines together:

- `VoIP timing window`: rolling summary of keep-alive schedule delay, iterate duration, and the worst loop gap in that window
- `VoIP iterate timing drift`: one-off warning when a keep-alive step ran late or took unusually long
- `Runtime loop blocked`: one-off warning when some other coordinator work starved the loop enough to threaten VoIP cadence

### Freeze investigation

When the app looks stuck during idle navigation, use the screenshot signal path as the first
evidence trigger:

```bash
yoyoctl remote logs --follow --filter ERROR
yoyoctl remote screenshot --readback
```

What to expect:

- `yoyoctl remote screenshot --readback` sends `SIGUSR1` to the app.
- `SIGUSR1` now does two things:
  - appends an all-thread traceback dump to `logs/yoyopod_errors.log`
  - logs a structured runtime snapshot before trying the queued screenshot capture
- recent runtime logs also expose VoIP keep-alive timing in three layers:
  - `VoIP keep-alive native iterate slow` means the Liblinphone keep-alive call itself blocked
  - `VoIP iterate timing drift` means the coordinator reached keep-alive late or the full iterate pass ran long
  - `Coordinator blocking span` points at nearby coordinator work that may have delayed keep-alives
- the periodic `VoIP timing window` summary rolls those samples up for hardware runs without logging every 20 ms iterate
- if the main loop is still healthy enough, you also get the PNG
- if the main loop is wedged and the PNG never appears, the error log is still the first place to inspect

For shadow-buffer comparison, use:

```bash
yoyoctl remote screenshot
```

That uses `SIGUSR2`, which captures the same traceback + runtime evidence but prefers the legacy
shadow-first screenshot path.

### Automatic responsiveness watchdog

For validation runs where you want the app to capture evidence on its own, enable the
opt-in responsiveness watchdog in `config/yoyopod_config.yaml` or via env vars:

```yaml
diagnostics:
  responsiveness_watchdog_enabled: true
  responsiveness_stall_threshold_seconds: 5.0
```

What it does:

- watches `loop_heartbeat_age_seconds` in the running app status
- captures one evidence bundle when the coordinator loop stops advancing past the threshold
- writes:
  - `logs/responsiveness/<timestamp>-<reason>.json`
  - `logs/responsiveness/<timestamp>-<reason>.traceback.txt`
- logs one summary line to `logs/yoyopod_errors.log` pointing at those artifacts

How to interpret the extra status markers in the JSON bundle:

- `input_activity_age_seconds`: raw or semantic input activity seen by the input side
- `handled_input_activity_age_seconds`: last input activity the coordinator actually drained
- `last_input_action` / `last_handled_input_action`: the latest action names on each side

If `input_activity_age_seconds` is fresh but `handled_input_activity_age_seconds` is stale, the
input side is still alive and the stall is likely between input delivery and the coordinator/UI
thread. If both are stale and `loop_heartbeat_age_seconds` is also stale, treat it as a broader
runtime stall.

### Production systemd service

```bash
yoyoctl remote service status
yoyoctl remote service install
yoyoctl remote service restart
yoyoctl remote service logs --lines 150
```

This installs `deploy/systemd/yoyopod@.service` onto the Pi as `yoyopod@<remote-user>.service`, enables it at boot, and records the merged `project_dir` in `/etc/default/yoyopod` so the service follows the same stable checkout path.

### Whisplay and PiSugar helpers

```bash
yoyoctl remote whisplay
yoyoctl remote whisplay --duration-seconds 45 --double-tap-ms 240 --long-hold-ms 900
yoyoctl remote lvgl-soak
yoyoctl remote rtc status
yoyoctl remote power
```

## Preflight

`yoyoctl remote preflight` is still useful, but it is a preparation step, not the full hardware-validation finish line.

```bash
yoyoctl remote preflight --branch <branch> --with-music --with-voip --with-lvgl-soak
```

What it does:

1. runs local `compileall`
2. runs local `uv run pytest -q`
3. syncs the chosen branch to the Raspberry Pi
4. runs the Raspberry Pi smoke pass

Use it before commit when you want an extra sanity pass, or before `yoyoctl remote validate` when you want a stricter gate.

## Dirty-Tree Escape Hatch

`yoyoctl remote rsync` still exists, but it is not the normal validation path.

Use it only when:

- the user explicitly wants to validate uncommitted local changes
- you are doing a one-off debugging session and have called out that the Pi is not running committed code

Commands:

```bash
yoyoctl remote rsync
yoyoctl remote rsync --skip-restart
```

If you use it, say clearly that the board is running a dirty-tree override instead of the committed branch/SHA flow.

## Suggested Daily Loop

1. Run local checks as needed:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/quality.py ci
   ```
2. Commit the intended change.
3. Push the branch.
4. Resolve the exact commit:
   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   ```
5. Validate on the Pi:
   ```bash
   yoyoctl remote validate --branch <branch> --sha <commit> --with-music --with-voip --with-lvgl-soak
   ```
6. Manually test on the target hardware while the app remains running.

## Release / Pre-Merge Checklist

- local branch is green with `uv run python scripts/quality.py ci`
- branch is pushed and reviewed
- `yoyoctl remote validate --branch <branch> --sha <commit> --with-music --with-voip --with-lvgl-soak` passes
- the app starts cleanly and stays running for manual hardware testing
- manual sanity still passes for display, input, music, SIP registration, and call flow

## Notes

- `yoyoctl remote validate` is the default board-validation contract for branches and PRs.
- `yoyoctl remote preflight` is intentionally non-launching.
- `yoyoctl remote service install` expects passwordless `sudo` or an interactive sudo policy on the Pi.
- `yoyoctl remote rsync` is a debugging escape hatch, not the normal deploy story.
- For deeper hardware debugging, use `docs/RPI_SMOKE_VALIDATION.md`.
