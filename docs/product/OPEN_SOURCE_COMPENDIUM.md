| Project | URL | One-Line Relevance | Integration Note |
|---------|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| **Raspberry Pi OS (Lite)** | https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ | Official Debian-based OS for Pi Zero 2W | Base OS; use Lite variant to minimize footprint. Enable systemd, disable unnecessary services. |
| **Buildroot** | https://buildroot.org/ | Custom embedded Linux build system | Build fully custom image with only needed packages (mpv, python3, lvgl deps). Better for production than Raspbian. |
| **Yocto Project** | https://www.yoctoproject.org/ | Industrial-grade embedded Linux builder | Overkill for YoYoPod but provides reproducible builds, layer for Pi Zero 2W exists (meta-raspberrypi). |
| **DietPi** | https://dietpi.com/ | Lightweight optimized Debian for Pi | Pre-optimized for minimal resource use; could fork for YoYoPod base. Active community. |
| **Alpine Linux** | https://alpinelinux.org/ | Musl-based, security-focused, small | ~130MB base. musl libc may cause Python C extension issues; test Liblinphone and native shims. |
| **NixOS** | https://nixos.org/ | Reproducible declarative Linux | Nix expressions for reproducible YoYoPod builds; steep learning curve but atomic rollbacks complement slot-deploy. |
| **postmarketOS** | https://postmarketos.org/ | Alpine-based mobile/embedded OS | Phone-oriented but has good ARM support, power management, modem integration patterns. |
| **Mender Hub meta-mender** | https://hub.mender.io/t/raspberry-pi-3-and-4/ | OTA-enabled Yocto layer for Pi | If migrating to Yocto, Mender integration provides robust A/B OTA (alternative to custom slot-deploy). |
| **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** | https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ | 64-bit kernel with 32-bit userland | Pi Zero 2W has 64-bit capable CPU; evaluate Python and cloud-worker memory use. |
| **PikaOS** | https://github.com/PikaOS-Linux | Gaming/performance oriented Debian fork | Not ideal for YoYoPod but has interesting low-latency kernel patches applicable to audio. |
| **Ubuntu Core** | https://ubuntu.com/core | Snap-based embedded Ubuntu | Snaps are heavy for Pi Zero 2W; however, strict confinement useful for parental control sandboxing. |
