# YoYoPod Core Documentation Guide

This page is the entry point for the repo docs.

If you are new here, read these first:

1. [`README.md`](../README.md) for the repo overview and quick start
2. [`docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for setup, running, validation, and daily workflow
3. [`docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the current runtime shape
4. [`docs/CANONICAL_STRUCTURE.md`](CANONICAL_STRUCTURE.md) for the current config/package ownership template

## Source of truth

When docs disagree, trust sources in this order:

1. Current code in `yoyopod/`
2. Current runtime and setup docs in this section
3. Rules and agent guidance in `rules/`, `AGENTS.md`, and `skills/`
4. Plans, checklists, and design specs
5. Archived docs under [`docs/archive/`](archive/)

Plan docs are useful, but they are not automatically the current implementation contract.

### Core runtime architecture

- [`SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md), top-level runtime topology plus startup/bootstrap flow
- [`CANONICAL_STRUCTURE.md`](CANONICAL_STRUCTURE.md), canonical config topology and domain package ownership
- [`CLOUD_PROVISIONING_AND_BACKEND.md`](CLOUD_PROVISIONING_AND_BACKEND.md), claimed-device auth, config sync, cache/status files, MQTT telemetry, and current backend-integration status
- [`RUNTIME_EVENT_FLOW.md`](RUNTIME_EVENT_FLOW.md), current event pipeline and coordinator ownership

- [`LOCAL_FIRST_MUSIC_PLAN.md`](LOCAL_FIRST_MUSIC_PLAN.md), current music direction and constraints
- [`MPV_DEPENDENCIES.md`](MPV_DEPENDENCIES.md), mpv-specific dependency and integration notes

## Plans, specs, and design work

These files are useful for context, but they are not all the same kind of document.

### Transitional or partly historical design docs

- [`LVGL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](LVGL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md), historical migration record with some still-relevant rationale
- [`VOICE_COMMAND_PLAN.md`](VOICE_COMMAND_PLAN.md), transitional design record, not the current `Ask` implementation contract
- [`VOICE_COMMAND_CHECKLIST.md`](VOICE_COMMAND_CHECKLIST.md), historical implementation checklist from an older branch snapshot
- [`ASK_SCREEN_DESIGN_SPEC.md`](ASK_SCREEN_DESIGN_SPEC.md), design target for the unified `Ask` screen, not automatic proof of implementation

### Active design or contract docs

- [`GLOBAL_AUDIO_DEVICE_FACADE_CONTRACT.md`](GLOBAL_AUDIO_DEVICE_FACADE_CONTRACT.md)
- [`WHISPLAY_SIMULATION_PARITY_CONTRACT.md`](WHISPLAY_SIMULATION_PARITY_CONTRACT.md)
- [`design-previews/`](design-previews/)

If one of these conflicts with the current code or the current runtime docs above, trust the current code and the current runtime docs.

## Historical implementation records

These are useful when you need to understand how the repo got here, but they are not the top-level source of truth for current architecture. Each of these files should say that plainly at the top.

- [`INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`](INTEGRATION_PLAN.md), implemented milestone record for VoIP + local music integration
- [`UI_RESTRUCTURE_PROPOSAL.md`](UI_RESTRUCTURE_PROPOSAL.md), refactor status record for the UI split and remaining cleanup
- [`PHASE2_SUMMARY.md`](PHASE2_SUMMARY.md), milestone summary for early screen integration
- [`CUBIE_A7Z_PIMORONI_SETUP.md`](CUBIE_A7Z_PIMORONI_SETUP.md), historical non-Whisplay bringup notes

## Generated planning workspace

- [`superpowers/README.md`](superpowers/README.md), status and usage notes for generated plan/spec workspaces
- [`superpowers/`](superpowers/), historical agent-generated plans and specs that may retain older repo names or environment-specific paths

Treat this directory as preserved planning context, not as the current implementation contract.

## Archived history

- [`archive/README.md`](archive/README.md), archive policy
- [`archive/`](archive/), historical milestone notes and prior proposals

Archive files are for historical context only. They are not the source of truth for the current runtime.

## Contributor and agent guidance

- [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), current agent/repo guidance
- [`../rules/project.md`](../rules/project.md), project rules and common commands
- [`../rules/architecture.md`](../rules/architecture.md), architecture constraints
- [`../rules/code-style.md`](../rules/code-style.md), style and typing rules
- [`../rules/deploy.md`](../rules/deploy.md), deploy workflow
- [`../skills/`](../skills/), task-specific Pi workflow skills
