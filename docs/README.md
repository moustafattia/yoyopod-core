# YoYoPod Core Documentation Guide

This page is the entry point for repo documentation.

If you are new here, read these first:

1. [`../README.md`](../README.md) for the repo overview and quick start
2. [`operations/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`](operations/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for setup, running, validation, and daily workflow
3. [`architecture/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`](architecture/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the current runtime shape
4. [`architecture/WORK_AREAS.md`](architecture/WORK_AREAS.md) for where active Rust-first work belongs
5. [`architecture/CANONICAL_STRUCTURE.md`](architecture/CANONICAL_STRUCTURE.md) for config and package ownership

## Source Of Truth

When docs disagree, trust sources in this order:

1. Current Rust runtime and host code in `device/`
2. Current deploy/runtime tooling in `deploy/` and `yoyopod_cli/`
3. Current runtime, operations, hardware, feature, and design docs under the folders below
4. Rules and agent guidance in `rules/`, `AGENTS.md`, and `skills/`
5. Current rules and agent guidance in `rules/`, `AGENTS.md`, and `skills/`

The retired Python app runtime has been deleted. Python remains only for
operations CLI, deploy, release, and validation orchestration.

Plan docs are useful context, but they are not automatically the current implementation contract.

## Folder Map

- [`architecture/`](architecture/README.md) - current runtime topology, package/config ownership, event flow, display/input contracts, and cross-screen UI contracts.
- [`operations/`](operations/README.md) - contributor workflow, setup, quality gates, release flow, dev/prod lanes, Pi validation, profiling, and OTA/deploy operations.
- [`hardware/`](hardware/README.md) - audio, power, deployed Pi dependencies, and board bringup notes.
- [`features/`](features/README.md) - cloud provisioning, cloud voice, local music, mpv, and remote playback contracts.
- [`design/`](design/README.md) - active screen/UI design targets, parity contracts, and visual previews.
- [`product/`](product/README.md) - product definition, V1 scope, positioning, technical priorities, and research material.
- [`assets/`](assets/) - images and media used by docs.
- [`../apps/`](../apps/) - future web and mobile applications.
- [`../packages/`](../packages/) - future shared contracts, SDKs, and app packages.

## Historical Context

Historical planning archives were removed from the tracked repo. Use merged PRs
and current docs for rationale; when docs disagree, trust current code.
