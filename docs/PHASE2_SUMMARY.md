# Phase 2 Summary: Screen Integration

**Last updated:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** Historical summary, corrected to current file paths

Phase 2 was the point where the integrated application stopped being a set of separate demos and became one navigable app.

## What Phase 2 Added

- screen instance setup inside `YoyoPodApp`
- screen registration with `ScreenManager`
- callback-driven transitions for call and music events
- stack cleanup for call-related screens
- production entrypoint via `yoyopod.py`

## Correct Current File References

The integration work lives in:

- `yoyopy/app.py`
- `yoyopod.py`

The older reference to `yoyopy/yoyopod_app.py` is no longer correct.

## Screen Set Registered By The App

- navigation: `home`, `menu`
- music: `now_playing`, `playlists`
- VoIP: `call`, `contacts`, `incoming_call`, `outgoing_call`, `in_call`

## Important Helper

`YoyoPodApp._pop_call_screens()` remains the key guard against call-screen stack buildup. That logic still exists in `yoyopy/app.py`.

## Later Refactor Note

After Phase 2, the UI package was refactored:

- `screens.py` was split into `yoyopy/ui/screens/`
- `screen_manager.py` moved to `yoyopy/ui/screens/manager.py`
- input and display were moved behind HAL packages

So the Phase 2 behavior is still relevant, but the old module layout is not.
