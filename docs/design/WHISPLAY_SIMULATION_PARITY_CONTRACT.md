# YoYoPod Whisplay / Simulation Parity Contract

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-22
**Status:** Implemented contract

## Problem Statement

`device/runtime/build/yoyopod-runtime --config-dir config` is the software-only preview of the current
Whisplay product UI. That preview is only useful if it renders the same layout
contract as hardware instead of drifting behind a second renderer.

## Current Contract

The supported portrait UI has one visual source of truth:

- Whisplay hardware: `240x280`, portrait, LVGL-only
- Simulation: `240x280`, portrait, browser preview of the same Whisplay render path

The browser is transport, not a second layout engine.

That also means simulation requires the native LVGL shim. If the shim is not
available, startup should fail loudly instead of silently reviving a second
renderer. The supported fix is to build the shim first with
`yoyopod build simulation` (or `yoyopod build ensure-native`).

## Implemented Direction

The Rust UI preview path reuses the same render contract as hardware:

1. LVGL scenes still own the object tree and layout behavior.
2. The native LVGL shim provides the shared scene/backend path.
3. Mock hardware mode exercises the worker protocol without reviving a second
   Python renderer.

## Goals

- keep simulation as the primary software-only preview of the current Whisplay UI
- treat Whisplay as the visual source of truth for the product
- remove duplicate layout behavior that can drift between hardware and browser preview
- preserve fast local and Pi-hosted browser preview for development
- keep simulation input ergonomic for developers while matching Whisplay output geometry

## Non-Goals

- emulate SPI timing, LCD refresh artifacts, or backlight latency
- reproduce panel color calibration exactly
- maintain a second renderer just for simulation

## Required Parity Surface

The following remain parity-sensitive for simulation:

- status bar height and icon placement
- hero-card position, size, radius, and padding
- footer copy position
- list item spacing and focus treatment
- Whisplay portrait safe-area assumptions

The first required screen set is still:

- main menu / hub
- Listen
- Talk
- Ask
- Setup
- Voice Commands
- Talk Contact
- Now Playing

## Verification Contract

Parity must be enforced with artifacts, not visual memory.

Required verification layers:

- unit or integration tests for shared geometry/profile values
- screenshot and adapter tests around the RGB565 framebuffer + browser preview path
- Pi-hosted validation using Whisplay screenshots from the live LVGL path

Small anti-aliasing or color differences can be tolerated. Geometry drift should not be.

## File Ownership

- `device/ui/`
  - owns Rust UI state, scene selection, rendering, and worker protocol
- `yoyopod_cli/pi/support/lvgl_binding/native/`
  - owns the native C LVGL shim used by the Rust UI build

## Acceptance Criteria

- `device/runtime/build/yoyopod-runtime --config-dir config` shows the same layout geometry as the current
  Whisplay UI for the required parity screens when the native LVGL shim has been built
- simulation no longer relies on a second drifting copy of Whisplay-first
  layout behavior
- the browser preview remains usable both locally and from the Pi IP
- output parity is preserved while simulation input stays developer-friendly
- UI work can use simulation as a trustworthy preview of Whisplay instead of a rough approximation
