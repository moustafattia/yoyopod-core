# Design Fidelity Workflow

Applies to: Figma-driven UI work for Whisplay and LVGL hardware scenes.

## Goal

When implementing or refining Whisplay UI from Figma, preserve the
product's existing screen model and make the real 240x280 device output
match the design as closely as possible on actual hardware.

## Canonical Target

- Whisplay is the canonical small-screen target: `240x280` portrait.
- Treat rounded display corners and edge clipping as real constraints.
  Leave visual safety margin at the top, sides, and footer.
- A screen is only "done" after it has been checked on the Pi, not just
  in LVGL readback output.

## Figma Intake Rules

- Prefer standard Figma Design links with `node-id=...`. A Figma Make link is acceptable only as a loose concept preview.
- Extract one runtime screen at a time. Do not try to reproduce an entire board as a single device screen.
- Map each Figma frame onto the existing YoYoPod information architecture and routes before changing code.
- Reuse the current navigation model. Do not introduce a second navigation system just because the Figma board is organized differently.
- If the Figma hint text conflicts with the real one-button behavior, keep the real behavior and update the copy to match the hardware interaction.

## Implementation Split

- Shared visual tokens and scene state belong in `device/ui/src/`.
- Screen controller behavior belongs in Rust UI scene modules.
- Native Whisplay scene parity belongs in:
  - `device/ui/src/lvgl/`
  - `device/ui/native/lvgl/`
- Raw LVGL layout logic should remain confined to Rust LVGL scene controllers and facade layers. Do not spread direct LVGL object code across unrelated app modules.

## Recommended Order Of Work

1. Extract the design intent from Figma:
   - identify layout
   - identify reusable components
   - identify colors, spacing, chips, cards, icons, and footer behavior
2. Fit the design to Whisplay constraints:
   - simplify dense layouts
   - preserve safe margins
   - shorten helper text if it clips on real hardware
3. Update shared theme primitives first.
4. Update the Rust screen controller in `device/ui/`.
5. Update the LVGL view layer.
6. Update the native LVGL scene when hardware parity requires it.
7. Validate locally with cargo checks (`cargo check`, `cargo test`).
8. Deploy to the Pi with `yoyopod target deploy` and validate on device.

## Extraction Heuristics

- Start by identifying reusable primitives such as:
  - large icon cards
  - action buttons
  - person headers
  - status chips
  - footer or hint bars
  - page dots
- Normalize those primitives into YoYoPod theme helpers instead of duplicating one-off measurements in every screen.
- Use the Figma design language, but compress it aggressively for `240x280`.
- Prefer one strong focal element per screen. Avoid dashboard-style compositions on Whisplay.

## Hardware Validation Loop

For Whisplay UI work, the standard loop is:

1. Validate locally:
   ```bash
   cargo check --manifest-path device/Cargo.toml --workspace --locked
   cargo test  --manifest-path device/Cargo.toml -p yoyopod-ui
   ```
2. Commit and push the branch you want to validate:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git rev-parse HEAD
   ```
3. Deploy the committed branch or exact SHA to the Pi:
   ```bash
   yoyopod target deploy --branch <branch>          # or --sha <commit>
   ```
4. Capture output from the Pi:
   ```bash
   yoyopod target screenshot
   yoyopod target logs --follow
   ```
5. Compare the captured result against Figma and adjust.

Automated on-Pi validation (`yoyopod target validate`) is a Round 1 stub
during the CLI rebuild. Validate manually until Round 2 restores it; see
`docs/ROADMAP.md`.

Dirty-tree deploys are not supported by `yoyopod target deploy` — the
CI-artifact contract requires a pushed commit. If you need to test
uncommitted state, commit to a throwaway branch first.

## Screenshot Interpretation

- Framebuffer screenshot: what the app tried to send to the display path.
- LVGL readback screenshot: what LVGL rendered internally.
- Real device photo: what the physical glass actually showed.

Use all three appropriately:

- Use framebuffer screenshots for fast layout validation.
- Use LVGL readback when validating the native LVGL scene itself.
- Use a real device photo when checking rounded-corner safety, physical edge clipping, brightness, or suspected panel-transfer issues.

## Native Rebuild Rule

- If `device/ui/native/lvgl/lv_conf.h` or Rust LVGL binding code changes, validate with a fresh CI Rust artifact before judging the hardware result.
- `yoyopod target deploy` and `yoyopod target restart` must not rebuild LVGL on the Pi. Do not assume a locally compiled Pi artifact reflects the committed code under test.

## Whisplay-Specific Acceptance Criteria

Before considering a Figma pass complete on Whisplay:

- the shared theme and the LVGL scene agree visually
- helper text fits within the footer safely
- status bar spacing is comfortable on real glass
- chips, dots, icons, and cards match the intended design hierarchy
- one-button hint text matches the actual interaction behavior
- a Pi screenshot or gallery has been captured after the final sync

## Commit And PR Hygiene

- Do not commit `temp/` screenshot artifacts.
- Keep gallery captures local unless the user explicitly asks to store them in-repo.
- In PR descriptions for design work, include both:
  - the visual areas changed
  - the validation steps used on the Pi
