# YoYoPod - Agent Instructions

Last Updated: 2026-04-28
Target Hardware: Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
Project: iPod-inspired VoIP + local music device with small-screen button UI

Purpose
- Keep this file small. It is the always-loaded agent brief, not a dump of the whole codebase.
- For detail, read the referenced docs instead of stuffing more into this file.

Guidance order
1. Current code in `yoyopod/`
2. `README.md` and `docs/README.md`
3. `rules/` for constraints and style
4. This file for quick operating context
5. `skills/` for deploy/debug playbooks
6. `.claude/` and `.agents/` as tool-facing mirrors

Read these rules first
- `rules/project.md`
- `rules/architecture.md`
- `rules/code-style.md`
- `rules/design-fidelity.md`
- `rules/voip.md`
- `rules/lvgl.md`
- `rules/logging.md`
- `rules/deploy.md`

Canonical deploy/debug skills
- `skills/yoyopod-deploy/SKILL.md`
- `skills/yoyopod-sync/SKILL.md`
- `skills/yoyopod-logs/SKILL.md`
- `skills/yoyopod-restart/SKILL.md`
- `skills/yoyopod-status/SKILL.md`
- `skills/yoyopod-screenshot/SKILL.md`
- `skills/yoyopod-rust-artifact/SKILL.md`
- `docs/operations/SLOT_DEPLOY.md` (slot-deploy + OTA-ready flow; coexists with the legacy skills above)

Current runtime summary
- Entrypoint: `yoyopod.py` -> `yoyopod.main` -> `YoyoPodApp`
- Main packages: `yoyopod/core/`, `yoyopod/integrations/`, `yoyopod/backends/`, `yoyopod/ui/`, `yoyopod/config/`
- Runtime structure: canonical `YoyoPodApp` in `yoyopod/core/application.py`, boot in `yoyopod/core/bootstrap/`, loop in `yoyopod/core/loop.py`, workers in `yoyopod/core/workers/`, diagnostics in `yoyopod/core/diagnostics/`; shared `scheduler -> bus -> ui` runtime seam under `yoyopod/core/`
- Backends: `yoyopod/backends/{music,voip,voice,cloud,network,power,location}/` — production audio is mpv (`music/`), production VoIP is Liblinphone (`voip/`)
- UI: `yoyopod/ui/{lvgl_binding,display,input,screens}/` — raw LVGL confined to `lvgl_binding/`
- Cross-language: Go cloud voice worker under `workers/voice/go/` (separate Go module, gated by CI)
- Production service templates: `deploy/systemd/`
- CLI package: `yoyopod_cli/` (flat, single `yoyopod` entry point)
- Tests: `tests/` (pytest testpath; Python 3.12+)

Pi lanes and bootstrap
- Dev lane: mutable hardware-testing checkout at `/opt/yoyopod-dev/checkout`, venv at `/opt/yoyopod-dev/venv`, service `yoyopod-dev.service`.
- Prod lane: immutable packaged slots under `/opt/yoyopod-prod`, service `yoyopod-prod.service`; use `remote release ...`, not `remote sync`.
- Check lane ownership first with `yoyopod remote mode status`; dev/prod services should not own hardware together.
- Fresh board: run the curl installer: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moustafattia/yoyopod-core/main/deploy/scripts/install_pi.sh | sudo -E bash -s --`; add `--release-url=<artifact-url>` for first prod install.
- Migration: `--migrate` preserves old config/logs for reference only. It does not copy old `~/yoyopod-core` into dev; live dev truth is `/opt/yoyopod-dev/checkout`.
- Hard cut: supported runtime owners are only `yoyopod-dev.service` and `yoyopod-prod.service`; `yoyopod@*.service`, `yoyopod-slot.service`, unmanaged `python yoyopod.py`, and `remote service ...` are legacy contamination paths.
- Dev deploy loop: `yoyopod remote mode activate dev`, then `yoyopod remote setup` once, then `yoyopod remote sync --branch <branch>`; add `--clean-native` after native/CMake/lib changes or branch switches.
- Rust binary deploy rule: commit and push first, then use the GitHub Actions artifact for the exact commit under test. Do not build Rust binaries on the Pi Zero 2W with `cargo build` or `yoyopod build rust-ui-poc` unless the user explicitly overrides this rule. Native C shim rebuilds via `--clean-native` remain allowed.
- Lane details live in `docs/operations/DEV_PROD_LANES.md`, dev workflow in `docs/operations/PI_DEV_WORKFLOW.md`, prod slot/OTA flow in `docs/operations/SLOT_DEPLOY.md`.

High-value commands
- Install/test env: `uv sync --extra dev`
- Tests: `uv run pytest -q`
- **CI quality gate (run before every commit + push):** `uv run python scripts/quality.py gate`
- **CI test suite (run before every commit + push):** `uv run pytest -q`
- Pi smoke: `yoyopod pi validate smoke`
- Remote operations: `yoyopod remote ...`
- Dev deploy: `yoyopod remote sync --branch <branch>` after `yoyopod remote mode activate dev`
- Full command reference: `yoyopod_cli/COMMANDS.md` (auto-generated; regenerate via `yoyopod dev docs`)

Pre-commit rule
- Before every `git commit` (including `--amend`) and every `git push`, run BOTH commands above. They mirror exactly what CI runs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — the `quality` job runs `scripts/quality.py gate` (black + ruff + mypy on gate paths, no pytest), and the `test` job runs `pytest -q` (full suite).
- Per-file pytest/ruff runs are NOT enough. CI gates format + lint + type + full test suite across the paths in `[tool.yoyopod_quality]`, and rendering/behavior can differ between local terminals and Linux CI (terminal width, color, `COLUMNS` env).
- Windows note: CI is Linux-only. A handful of tests have known Windows-specific failures (faulthandler, native shim loading, Windows-path/font behavior) that are green on Linux. If you're on Windows and see failures, diff them against the latest green main CI run — flag only NEW failures.
- When dispatching implementer subagents, include "run `uv run python scripts/quality.py gate && uv run pytest -q` before the final commit step" as an explicit requirement.

Hardware modes
- Pimoroni Display HAT Mini: landscape + four buttons on the shared LVGL path
- PiSugar Whisplay: portrait + single button
- Simulation: shared LVGL browser preview + keyboard/web-button input

Guardrails
- Prefer narrow, reviewable changes.
- Keep raw LVGL confined to `yoyopod/ui/lvgl_binding/` and display-layer code.
- Prefer `yoyopod remote` over ad-hoc SSH sequences.
- Current code and runtime docs beat old plan docs when they disagree.
- `docs/history/` and `docs/archive/` are history, not truth.
