# YoyoPod Core

YoyoPod is an iPod-inspired Raspberry Pi application that combines SIP calling, local-first music playback, and a small-screen button UI.

Current product surface:
- `Listen` - local-only music with `Playlists`, `Recent`, and `Shuffle`
- `Talk` - contact-first calls and voice notes
- `Ask` - staged shell for future safe AI interactions
- `Setup` - power, care, and device status

Approved contacts are now backend-synced policy data:

- the Pi stores mutable people data in `data/people/contacts.yaml`
- backend config sync can merge household-approved contacts into that file
- contacts may carry both `sip_address` and `phone_number`
- calling is currently SIP-first; GSM numbers are stored for later enablement
- a claimed device may bootstrap prestored local contacts to the backend once
  when the backend household contact list is still empty

Supported display/input modes:
- Pimoroni Display HAT Mini: `320x240` landscape with four buttons
- PiSugar Whisplay HAT: `240x280` portrait with a single PTT-style button
- Simulation mode: browser display with keyboard and web-button input

## Quick Start

Local-only contributor path:

```bash
uv run yoyoctl setup host
uv run yoyoctl setup verify-host
python yoyopod.py --simulate
uv run python scripts/quality.py ci
```

If you plan to validate on a Raspberry Pi or use GitHub CLI helpers, verify those host prerequisites explicitly before you need them:

```bash
uv run yoyoctl setup verify-host --with-remote-tools
uv run yoyoctl setup verify-host --with-github
```

For the full setup, validation, and Pi workflow, start with:
- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)
- [`docs/CONTRIBUTOR_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTOR_WORKFLOW.md)
- [`docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
- [`docs/SETUP_CONTRACT.md`](docs/SETUP_CONTRACT.md)

The current setup commands define a baseline executable contract, not a fully
solved setup story. Non-apt assets like Vosk models and board/modem-specific
bringup still need explicit follow-through.

Run on hardware:

```bash
python yoyopod.py
```

Board-specific hardware defaults can live in `config/boards/<board>/`.
Known boards currently include `rpi-zero-2w` and `radxa-cubie-a7z`, and
the app auto-selects those on matching hardware. You can also force one:

```bash
YOYOPOD_CONFIG_BOARD=radxa-cubie-a7z python yoyopod.py
YOYOPOD_CONFIG_BOARD=rpi-zero-2w python yoyopod.py
```
