YoYoPod is being built by software-engineer fathers in Stuttgart, Germany. The idea is simple: give kids a dedicated little device for music, voice messages, and staying in touch, without throwing them into the chaos of a general-purpose phone.

The current prototype runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and uses the Whisplay HAT because it gives us a great bundle for fast iteration: screen, side push-to-talk button, microphone, and speaker. That is our prototype path, not a permanent promise about the final hardware. The long-term device may ship with its own display and driver.

## What YoYoPod Can Do

- `Music playback` - local-first music, playlists, recent tracks, shuffle, and a simple now-playing flow.
- `Calls and voice messages` - family-friendly calling, quick voice notes, and a contact-first Talk experience.
- `Location and connectivity` - 4G modem support, GPS/location awareness, and device-level network handling.
- `Device care` - battery/power integration, watchdogs, runtime diagnostics, and Pi validation tooling.
- `A physical interaction model` - small-screen navigation plus a side push-to-talk button instead of a UI built around tapping glass all day.

## The Software Stack

This repository contains the software that runs the current YoYoPod prototype:

- `yoyopod/core/` - app lifecycle, scheduler, event bus, runtime loop, diagnostics, and shared state.
- `yoyopod/integrations/` - higher-level product capabilities like calling, music, power, network, location, and cloud sync.
- `yoyopod/backends/` - concrete hardware and service adapters such as Liblinphone, mpv, modem, and power backends.
- `yoyopod/ui/` - the device UI, LVGL binding, screens, and input/display glue.
- `yoyopod_cli/` - developer and device operations tooling for setup, deploy, validation, and diagnostics.

If you want the architecture view instead of the product view, start with [docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Bring Up The Prototype

This repo is Raspberry Pi hardware-first. To work on the real device path, plan around:

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- current Whisplay-based prototype hardware
- the modem path if you want to validate 4G/GPS behavior

Typical bring-up flow:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run yoyopod setup host
uv run yoyopod setup verify-host --with-remote-tools
python yoyopod.py
```

Basic hardware validation:

```bash
yoyopod pi validate smoke
```

For remote deploy, Pi sync, and troubleshooting, use the `yoyopod remote ...` and `yoyopod pi ...` commands documented below.
