# Rollback: swap `current` and `previous` symlinks, then restart the service.

# yoyopod-slot.service's OnFailure=) or manually by an operator.

# Contract:
#   * /opt/yoyopod/current must be a symlink
#   * /opt/yoyopod/previous must be a symlink
# If either precondition fails, exit nonzero and DO NOT touch anything.
